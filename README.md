# Rock Paper Scissors (The Odin Project JavaScript Task)

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum. The game runs entirely using **browser alerts** and prompts.

## Overview

- The player competes against the computer.
- The game plays **5 rounds** total.
- Player input is collected using the `prompt()` dialog.
- The computer chooses randomly using `Math.random()`.
- Round results and the final winner are shown using `alert()` pop-ups.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game will automatically prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. Results will be shown via alert boxes after each round and at the end of the game.

## Notes

- This version focuses on learning JavaScript basics.
- The game uses `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction instead of the browser console or HTML page elements.
